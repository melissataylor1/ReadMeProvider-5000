# Description
### Why was this project significant?
This weeks module introduced the FullStack Flex class to Node.js, and our first introduction to Backend Devleopment in this course. So this project allowed learners to summarize their introductory knowledge to both Node and BackEnd learning. As Node is so prevalent in the web development community, projects such as this are important for our fundamental knowledge. This project not only provides us with practice, but also familiarizes us with real-world applications of back end codes like Node. 


### What did this project ask of us? 
The goal of this challenge was to use Node in tandem with Javascript to create a command line application that acts as a README template. It prompts the user for questions on their project and automatically generates a professional README file with license information, table of contents and contact information. It also has a table of contents and images links for the license badges. 
For this project, we were given starter code to clone.
